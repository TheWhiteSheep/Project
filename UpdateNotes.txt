Quick fix:
- CrouchedHalfHeight was changed to use the function "SetCrouchedHalfHeight(60.0f);" due to API Change.

AMyBaseCharacter:
- Added: OnChangePerspective() function which lets you change camera perspective from ThirdPerson to FirstPerson.
- Added: OnInteract() function that lets you interact with objects using a linetrace system using BaseInteractDistance and CameraDistance
- Added: BaseInteractDistance which is the base interact when you're in first person, by default its 120.0f. When swapped to ThirdPerson CameraDistance is added onto the value.
- Added: CameraDistance which is the distance from the Camera to the Character. This is also used in the Interact system.

AMyBaseDoor:
- Multiple variables that help dictate if the door is open or closed.
- Multiple functions that help replicate the door movement over network.

AMyCameraManager: 
- Provides smooth camera movement while crouching to avoid jerky transitions.

UMyBaseMovementComponent: 
- Enables crouching by default (NavAgentProps.bCanCrouch).
- Sets crouch height (CrouchedHalfHeight).
- Added explanatory comments.
- Added StartCrouching() and StopCrouching() functions to manage crouch flags manually.

Fixed:
- AMyBasePlayerController: Automatically adds the input mapping context (IMC_Default) in the constructor, eliminating the need to update it manually in the Blueprint controller.
