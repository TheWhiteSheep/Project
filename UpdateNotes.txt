UMyStaminaComponent
- Added: A new Actor Component that manages stamina. It includes replicated stamina values, functions for increasing, decreasing, and setting stamina, as well as utility functions to check if the player can sprint or has full stamina. Broadcasts events when stamina changes and supports timer-based regeneration/drain.

UMyBaseWidget
- Added: Support for displaying the player’s stamina. Introduced StaminaBar (bound to a UProgressBar in the widget) and UpdateStaminaBar() function to update its fill percentage. Added OnStaminaChangedHandler() to respond to stamina changes in real time, similar to the health bar.

UMyBaseMovementComponent:
- StartCrouching() now checks if we are not in the air before crouching.
- StopCrouching() now checks if we were crouching before trying to reset the flag.

AMyBaseCharacter:
- Updated: The widget property name was changed to be more readable.
- Updated: BeginPlay() to create and bind the widget’s stamina bar (StaminaBar) to the component’s OnStaminaChanged delegate.
- Updated: StartSprinting() and StopSprinting() to check stamina and trigger the stamina manipulation timer via the component.
- Added: Integrated UMyStaminaComponent into the character.
- Added: Created and initialized the stamina component in the constructor.

Quick fix:
- CrouchedHalfHeight was changed to use the function "SetCrouchedHalfHeight(60.0f);" due to API Change. 

Added: 9/23/2025:

AMyBaseCharacter:
- Added: OnChangePerspective() function which lets you change camera perspective from ThirdPerson to FirstPerson.
- Added: OnInteract() function that lets you interact with objects using a linetrace system using BaseInteractDistance and CameraDistance
- Added: BaseInteractDistance which is the base interact when you're in first person, by default its 120.0f. When swapped to ThirdPerson CameraDistance is added onto the value.
- Added: CameraDistance which is the distance from the Camera to the Character. This is also used in the Interact system.

AMyBaseDoor:
- Multiple variables that help dictate if the door is open or closed.
- Multiple functions that help replicate the door movement over network.

AMyCameraManager: 
- Provides smooth camera movement while crouching to avoid jerky transitions.

UMyBaseMovementComponent: 
- Enables crouching by default (NavAgentProps.bCanCrouch).
- Sets crouch height (CrouchedHalfHeight).
- Added explanatory comments.
- Added StartCrouching() and StopCrouching() functions to manage crouch flags manually.

Fixed:
- AMyBasePlayerController: Automatically adds the input mapping context (IMC_Default) in the constructor, eliminating the need to update it manually in the Blueprint controller.
