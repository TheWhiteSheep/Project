UMyBaseWidget / Health System
- Implemented a health bar widget that dynamically updates based on the character’s health.
- Added UpdateHealthBar(float Percent) to handle health percentage and color changes (green → yellow → orange → red depending on health).
- Added OnHealthChangedHandler() to bind the widget to UMyHealthComponent::OnHealthChanged so the UI updates automatically whenever health changes.
- Setup the widget for the locally controlled player only in AMyBaseCharacter::BeginPlay().
- Ensured proper validation for MyHealthComponent and HealthWidgetClass to avoid crashes.

AMyCameraManager
- Provides smooth camera movement while crouching to avoid jerky transitions.

UMyBaseMovementComponent
- Enables crouching by default (NavAgentProps.bCanCrouch).
- Sets crouch height (CrouchedHalfHeight).
- Added explanatory comments.
- Added StartCrouching() and StopCrouching() to manage crouch flags manually.

Fixed
- AMyBasePlayerController automatically adds the input mapping context (IMC_Default) in the constructor, eliminating the need to update it manually in Blueprint.
